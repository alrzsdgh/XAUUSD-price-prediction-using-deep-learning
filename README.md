predicting the price of xauusd using deep learning

In this repository I used a BILSTM model to predict xauusd (gold) values in 5-minute timeframe. File **predict_xauusd.ipynb** is a full colab notebook which contains codes and results of this project. This model can predict the values close to training dataset very well. However it nust be considered that this does not mean this model is good for real trading and can only work as an accessory tool for traders.
